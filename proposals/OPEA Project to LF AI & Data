Requested project maturity level: Sandbox | Incubation | Graduated.
Sandbox

Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history, ongoing development).
OPEA is an ecosystem orchestration framework to efficiently integrate performant GenAI technologies and workflows leading to quicker GenAI adoption and business value.

Statement on alignment with LF AI’s mission.
LF AI & Data’s Mission: 
The mission of LF AI & Data is to build and support an open artificial intelligence (AI) and data community, and drive open source innovation in the AI and data domains by enabling collaboration and the creation of new opportunities for all the members of the community.
At Intel, our goal is to meet and enable developers where they are and that is by and far the open source community. Open source projects have pushed AI innovation further faster. One output of this innovation is the advent of GenAI which is currently in a state of kinetic innovation a byproduct of which is fragmentation of techniques and tools. We see a need for an ecosystem orchestration framework to efficiently integrate performant GenAI technologies and workflows leading to quicker GenAI adoption and business value. OPEA is that framework.
